[h1]Gravload[/h1]
Keep your gravship stocked without letting colonists raid the launch pantry. Gravload designates “separate stock” zones, gives you a transfer console, and keeps normal hauling away from the ship unless you explicitly order it.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Separate-stock toggles[/b] – Flag any stockpile or storage building for gravship use only.
[*][b]Two-column transfer UI[/b] – Queue load (colony → stock) and unload (stock → colony) jobs with search, sorting, and per-stack counts.
[*][b]Pending transfer list[/b] – Track every stack that pawns are already carrying and cancel problem jobs individually.
[*][b]Safety rails[/b] – Disable “Allow pawn auto use and reorganize” to keep colonists (and animals) out of protected stores unless you give a direct command.
[/list]

[h1]How To Use[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Toggle [b]Separate stock[/b] on the stockpiles / storage buildings that should belong to the gravship.
[*]Open [b]Manage separate stock[/b] to assign load or unload orders.
[*]Use the pending list to cancel stacks that no longer fit, then close the dialog to let pawns haul.
[/olist]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- Built for RimWorld 1.6.
- Uses vanilla storage rules; deep/virtual storage mods may need patches so their slot groups are detected.
- Only humanlike pawns with the Hauling work type run these jobs—animals sit this one out.
