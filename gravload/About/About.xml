Lock down critical supplies, keep the gravship loaded, and stop colonists from “borrowing” your launch fuel. Gravload adds:

• Separate-stock designations for any stockpile or storage building.
• A dedicated management dialog for loading and unloading stacks.
• Pending transfer tracking so you can cancel individual jobs mid-haul.
• Pawn safeguards—if auto use is disabled, haulers ignore the protected cells unless ordered otherwise.

Target version: RimWorld 1.6. Compatible with vanilla storage rules; deep/virtual storage mods may need patches so their slot groups are discovered.
